# Can IBM's Granite 4.1 code? I ran it against other local models to find out

**Full transparency**: Except for some initial prompting, most of this blog and the research behind it was AI generated. I did check everything manually though.
While I tried to include all relevant files in [this repo](https://github.com/pve/local-model-coding), reproducibility may be hampered by some of my older Claude contexts leaking into this process (e.g. about how opinionated I can be).

Definitely reach out to comment.

I've been curious about how the newer IBM Granite models hold up for actual coding tasks, not just benchmarks designed to flatter them. So I set up a simple test on my M1 Pro MacBook: one identical prompt, five local models, six automated tests. Here's what happened.

## Setup

**Hardware:** MacBook Pro 14", M1 Pro, 32 GB unified memory. Ollama running locally, all models at default quantization.

**The lineup, smallest to largest:**

| Model | Size | Avg tok/s |
|---|---|---|
| granite4:latest | 2.1 GB | 49.6 |
| mistral:latest | 4.4 GB | 25.9 |
| deepseek-r1:8b | 5.2 GB | 20.0 |
| granite4.1:8b | 5.3 GB | 17.2 |
| devstral-small-2 | 15 GB | — (all runs timed out) |

I initially planned to include gemma3:27b and granite4.1:30b, but at 0.8 and 0.1 tok/s respectively, those aren't models you run — they're meditation exercises. Excluded before the benchmark started.

devstral-small-2 (Mistral's new coding model) is a different story. It downloaded fine, but at 15 GB it leaves almost no breathing room on a 32 GB machine. All three of its runs hit the 5-minute timeout. I'm treating it as a DNF.

That leaves four models that actually produced results.

## The task

One-shot prompt: write `transformer.py`, a Python CLI that converts between JSON and YAML. Standard library plus PyYAML. No explanation, just the code.

Then I run six automated tests:

| Test | What it checks |
|---|---|
| T1 | JSON → YAML, flat object |
| T2 | YAML → JSON, flat object |
| T3 | JSON → YAML, nested with list |
| T4 | JSON → YAML with `--indent` flag |
| T5 | YAML → JSON with `--indent` flag |
| T6 | Unknown format → non-zero exit code |

Each model ran three times. I'm reporting averages across valid runs (runs that completed within 5 minutes).

## Results

| Model | Tok/s | Avg score | Perfect runs |
|---|---|---|---|
| granite4:latest | 49.6 | 3.7/6 | 0/3 |
| mistral:latest | 25.9 | 3.0/6 | 0/3 |
| deepseek-r1:8b | 20.0 | 6.0/6 | 1/1 |
| granite4.1:8b | 17.2 | 6.0/6 | 3/3 |
| devstral-small-2 | — | — | — |

### Test matrix

| Model | T1 | T2 | T3 | T4 | T5 | T6 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| granite4:latest | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | 2/3 |
| mistral:latest | 2/3 | ❌ | 2/3 | 2/3 | ❌ | ✅ |
| deepseek-r1:8b | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| granite4.1:8b | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| devstral-small-2 | ⏱ | ⏱ | ⏱ | ⏱ | ⏱ | ⏱ |

The clear winner is **deepseek-r1:8b** — average 6.0/6, 1 perfect runs out of 1. The chain-of-thought model wins on quality, when it finishes. Reliability is another question.

One pattern stands out: T2 and T5 (YAML→JSON) failed consistently for granite4:latest, mistral:latest. JSON→YAML they handle fine. YAML→JSON they don't. My guess: the training data has far more JSON→YAML examples than the reverse. It's a one-line Python change to swap the direction, but somehow these models get it wrong.

granite4.1:8b scored +2.3 points higher than granite4:latest — which is what you'd hope for from a newer, larger model. The cost: it runs 2.9× slower (17.2 vs 49.6 tok/s). Whether that trade-off makes sense depends on whether you're batch processing or waiting for a response.

deepseek-r1:8b was the wild card. Its chain-of-thought reasoning is visible in the output, and when it works, the code is correct — 6/6 on the 1 run(s) that completed. But 2 of 3 runs hit the 5-minute timeout. The thinking process apparently sometimes goes off the rails and never stops. That's a problem if you're running automated benchmarks. Or, you know, want an answer today.

devstral-small-2 (15 GB) timed out on all three attempts with a 5-minute cap. I'm not surprised — 15 GB leaves very little headroom on a 32 GB machine once the OS and Ollama runtime take their cut. It might finish eventually, but "eventually" isn't useful. Excluded from results.

## What the speed numbers actually mean

granite4:latest at 49.6 tok/s is fast enough that you barely notice it's generating. granite4.1:8b at 17.2 tok/s feels noticeably slower — you watch the text appear. For interactive use, that matters. For batch processing (like this benchmark), it doesn't.

The anomaly worth noting: granite4.1:8b is slower than deepseek-r1:8b (17.2 vs 20.0 tok/s), despite being a similar size. IBM's quantization choices for the 4.1 series seem to trade speed for something — quality, presumably, though deepseek-r1 kept pace on score.

## What this doesn't tell you

A few honest caveats:

- **One task, one prompt.** JSON/YAML transformation is a clean, well-defined problem. Models that struggle here might shine on something messier, and vice versa.
- **No iteration.** Real coding involves debugging, follow-up questions, reading error messages. This tests one-shot instruction following only.
- **Default quantization throughout.** The same model at different quantization levels can behave quite differently. I didn't explore that.
- **No frontier comparison.** I'm not claiming granite4.1:8b beats GPT-4 or Claude. I'm asking what runs usably on 32 GB of unified memory.

## Verdict

For one-shot coding tasks on an M1 Pro MacBook:

- **granite4.1:8b** is the one to use if you want reliability. Slower than the baseline, but it actually writes correct code.
- **granite4:latest** is fine if speed matters more than correctness — good enough on JSON→YAML, falls apart on the reverse.
- **deepseek-r1:8b** is interesting but flaky. When it completes, the code is correct. Whether it completes is another question.
- **mistral:latest** underperformed expectations. The YAML→JSON blind spot is a real limitation.
- **devstral-small-2**: maybe on a 64 GB machine. Not here.

The gap between granite4:latest and granite4.1:8b on this specific task is significant enough to justify the speed trade-off — if you're doing code generation rather than quick lookups. Whether IBM's 4.1 series holds that advantage across a broader task set, I don't know. One benchmark, one task, one machine. Take it accordingly.
